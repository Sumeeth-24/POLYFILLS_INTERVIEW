## ðŸ“Œ What Are Polyfills?

**Polyfills** are code snippets that implement modern JavaScript features in older environments where those features are not natively available. They also serve as a great way to deeply understand how JavaScript functions like `Array.map`, `Promise`, `bind`, etc., actually work.

In interviews, you're often asked to write polyfills to:
- Demonstrate a deep understanding of language fundamentals
- Showcase your problem-solving ability without relying on built-ins
- Handle edge cases and mimic native behaviors
